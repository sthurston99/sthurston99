`I spent over 50k on a computer science degree and all I got was this lousy GitHub page.`

ðŸ‘‹ Hey all, I'm Simon. I'm a former CS/ECE student from Rowan University in the good ol' New Jers of Ey, who is presently working in IT. My coding knowledge is extremely broad with little dips in holes where I've actually bothered to learn some in-depth practical knowledge. Most of my projects are small, module-sized utilities to make life a little easier in my day-to-day. I'm trying to teach myself more modern programming theories, like working with APIs and async nonsense, but It's an uphill battle every day for knowledge that, realistically, is only going to help me marginally with my career choices.

I've previously given talks about Git and Version Control at Rowan's ProfHacks, as well as generally being a mentor to people in coding things, because as much as I'll sell myself short, I am somewhat ok at doing things.

I'm an Open-Source, Libre, Free Software Die-Hard, preferring to use `neovim` as my editor of choice, or when I'm forced into an enterprise environment that's all Microshafted up, VSCodium.

I started programming in BASIC around when I was 6 years old, tinkering around on my family's old Gateway behemoth. Since then I have continued tinkering with computers on pretty much every level. People on here say they're full-stack from doing front and backend? Try building a processor, OS, and HAL from scratch on TOP of that! Don't, actually, I went for 2 college degrees and currently have zero due to money woes, and I'd rather not have anyone else go down this doomed path.

Anyways feel free to browse my repos, and clone whatever you'd like. It's here for a reason after all.
